### Panel 3-1 
Ordination of grids

```{r}
# axes 1 and 2
rs_3_1 <- ggplot(rs_PCoA_V, 
                       aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, col = Grid, group = Squirrel.ID)) + 
  geom_point() + # points are samples
  theme_bw()
rs_3_1
# add individual lines
rs_3_1 + geom_line() # lines are individuals
# add ellipses by grid
rs_3_1 + stat_ellipse(aes(group=Grid))
# add ellipses by grid and individual lines
# panel by season and year
rs_3_1 + 
  geom_line() + 
  stat_ellipse(aes(group=Grid)) +
  facet_grid(Season~Year)
```

### Panel 3-2 
Ordination of grids with diet
```{r}
# axes 1 and 2
rs_3_2 <- ggplot(rs_PCoA_V, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, group = Squirrel.ID, shape = FoodSupplement)) + #, shape = Grid
  geom_point() + # points are samples
  # add lines connecting individuals?
  #geom_line() +
  # just keep 2008
  theme_bw() + #facet_grid(Year~.) +
  # each grid is an ellipse, coloured by food supplementation
  stat_ellipse(aes(group=Grid, colour=FoodSupplement)) 
rs_3_2
```

### Panel 3-3 
Ordination of grids with parent-offspring relationships
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Sire
# axes 1 and 2
rs_3_3S <- ggplot(rs_PCoA_V, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, col = as.character(SireID))) + 
  geom_point() + # points are samples
  guides(col = F) +
  theme_bw()
rs_3_3S
# add facetting by grid and year
rs_3_3S + facet_grid(Year~Grid)
# add ellipse (specific sires)
rs_3_3S + stat_ellipse(aes(group=as.character(SireID), colour=as.character(SireID)))
# add ellipse with facetting
rs_3_3S + facet_grid(Year~Grid) +
  stat_ellipse(aes(group=as.character(SireID), 
                   colour=as.character(SireID)))
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Dame
# axes 1 and 2
rs_3_3 <- ggplot(rs_PCoA_V, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, col = as.character(DamID))) + 
  geom_point() + # points are samples
  guides(col = F) +
  theme_bw()
rs_3_3
# add facetting by grid and year
rs_3_3 + facet_grid(Year~Grid)
# add ellipse (specific dams)
rs_3_3 + stat_ellipse(aes(group=as.character(DamID), colour=as.character(DamID)))
# add ellipse with facetting
rs_3_3 + facet_grid(Year~Grid) +
  stat_ellipse(aes(group=as.character(DamID), 
                   colour=as.character(DamID)))
# parent offspring by line
```


### Panel 3-4
Ordination of grids with movement between grids.
Since I don't really have movement between grids, going to colour points by their X Y location and facet by replicate (grid/year).
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rs_PCoA_V %>%
  mutate("Location" = paste(Location.X, Location.Y, sep = ", ")) %>%
  # axes 1 and 2
  ggplot(., aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, col = Location)) + 
  geom_point() + # points are samples
  facet_grid(Year~Grid) +
  guides(col=FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
```
## Proposal Figure 4
```{r}
rs_jaccard <- read_qza("~/OneDrive - University of Guelph/Alicia's Thesis/red-squirrel-w2020/core-metrics-phylogenetic/jaccard_distance_matrix.qza")$data %>%

  # .x for sample 1, .y for sample 2
  left_join(., rs_q2_metadata, by = c("sampleid2" = "SampleID"))
View(rs_jaccard)
```

```{r}
# create a new column with the relationship between individuals
# if there is an NA in either of the DamID/SireID columns, then the relationship cannot be determined (so is therefore an NA)
rs_jaccard$Relationship <- ifelse(rs_jaccard$Squirrel.ID.x == rs_jaccard$Squirrel.ID.y, "self",
  ifelse(rs_jaccard$Squirrel.ID.x == rs_jaccard$DamID.y | rs_jaccard$Squirrel.ID.y == rs_jaccard$DamID.x, 
         "mother-offspring",

      ifelse(rs_jaccard$DamID.x == rs_jaccard$DamID.y & rs_jaccard$SireID.x == rs_jaccard$SireID.y, 
             "full-sibling",
        ifelse(rs_jaccard$DamID.x == rs_jaccard$DamID.y | rs_jaccard$SireID.x == rs_jaccard$SireID.y, 
               "half-sibling",
          "unrelated")))))
```

```{r}
# create a new grid column
rs_jaccard$Grid <- ifelse(rs_jaccard$Grid.x == rs_jaccard$Grid.y, "Same Grid", "Different Grid")
# create a new, more specific grid column
rs_jaccard$GridS <- ifelse(rs_jaccard$Grid.x == "KL" & rs_jaccard$Grid.x == rs_jaccard$Grid.y, "KL",
                           ifelse(rs_jaccard$Grid.x == "AG" & rs_jaccard$Grid.x == rs_jaccard$Grid.y, "AG",

                                                       "Different Grid")))))
```

```{r}
# cread a new year column
rs_jaccard$Year <- ifelse(rs_jaccard$Year.x == rs_jaccard$Year.y, "Same Year", "Different Year")
# cread a new, more specific year column
rs_jaccard$YearS <- ifelse(rs_jaccard$Year.x == 2008 & rs_jaccard$Year.x == rs_jaccard$Year.y, 2008, 
                          ifelse(rs_jaccard$Year.x == 2009 & rs_jaccard$Year.x == rs_jaccard$Year.y, 2009,
                                 ifelse(rs_jaccard$Year.x == 2010 & rs_jaccard$Year.x == rs_jaccard$Year.y, 2010,
                                        "Different Year")))
```

```{r}
# new food supplement column
rs_jaccard$FoodSupplement <- ifelse(rs_jaccard$FoodSupplement.x == "No" & rs_jaccard$FoodSupplement.x == rs_jaccard$FoodSupplement.y, "No", 
                                    ifelse(rs_jaccard$FoodSupplement.x == "Yes" & rs_jaccard$FoodSupplement.x == rs_jaccard$FoodSupplement.y, "Yes", "Either"))
```

### Left Panel
Boxplot of dissimilarity of shared diets
```{r}
# remove rows where the relationship is unknown and the distance is 0 (meaning it is comparing a sample to itself)
rs_4L <- rs_jaccard %>% filter(Jaccard > 0) %>%
  # make a boxplot
  ggplot(., aes(x = FoodSupplement, y = Jaccard)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  # modify theme and tick text
  theme_bw() +
  # reorder x axis
  scale_x_discrete(limits=c("Either","Yes","No"))
rs_4L
# add general facet (grid, year)
rs_4L + facet_grid(Year~Grid)
# add specific facet (grid, year)
rs_4L + facet_grid(YearS~GridS)
```

### Right Panel
Boxplot of dissimilarity of parent-offspring pairs vs whole grid (this is very similar to what the original paper had - I have just adjusted the facetting they had)

```{r}
# remove rows where the relationship is unknown and the distance is 0 (meaning it is comparing a sample to itself)
rs_jaccard %>% 
  drop_na(Relationship) %>%
  filter(Jaccard > 0) %>%
  # make a boxplot
  ggplot(., aes(x = Relationship, y = Jaccard)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + facet_grid(Year~Grid) +
  # modify theme and tick text
  theme_bw() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 34, hjust = 1)) +
  # the relatinoships have been reordered to match the ones in the paper
  scale_x_discrete(limits=c("self","mother-offspring","father-offspring", "full-sibling", "half-sibling", "unrelated"))
```

## Proposal Figure 5
Line graph of dissimilarity between the focal individual and others sampled from the same location over time
I am going to focus on individuals sampled at two locations (ideally multiple times at both locations)

```{r}
# add location information
rs_jaccard$Location <- ifelse(rs_jaccard$sampleid1 == rs_jaccard$sampleid2, "Same Sample",

                                     "Same Squirrel, Different Location", NA))))))
# add date information
rs_jaccard$CollectionDate <- ifelse(rs_jaccard$CollectionDate.x == rs_jaccard$CollectionDate.y,
                                    "Same Date", "Different Date")
